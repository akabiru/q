## Running the app

```bash
$ ./cli.rb 5 # outputs result
```

### Idea (Work In Progress)

- create ORM Model abstraction layer such that we have unique strand, standard and question objects
- cycle through strands, pick random standard and subsequntly pick random question
- Possibly improve distribution via [simulated anneling](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/29709/algorithm-to-distribute-items-evenly)

🤞🏾
